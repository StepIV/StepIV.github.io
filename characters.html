								When I first set out to develop this game, I decided that I would put the greatest focus on my characters. From the very start 
								I knew that I wanted a strong female lead who was excellent with a sword and that is where Fiona came in. That however, is all 
								I had for the longest time. I struggled with her character design and my artistic abilities are rather lacking, so I set out to 
								find someone who could take my vision of this character and bring it to life. I discovered Artstation in my search for the right 
								artist for the job. That is when I discovered Oreki Genya's page. I saw that she had done a lot of League of Legends fan art and 
								that she took on commissions. I saw how much character her pieces had and I knew at that moment that she could do a great job of
								bringing Fiona to life (I actually didn't have a name for my lead until much later). I reached out to her back in April and she 
								got back to me a few days later. We have communicated rather well despite a 13 hour time difference since she lives in Japan and I 
								live in the United States. She has been great to work with and you should expect to see more of her work on my site as development 
								gets underway.

								Fiona is supposed to be a very mobile character so I didn't want to weigh her down with heavy armor. That's when I figured leather might be alright 
								because it's still sturdy and anything is more flexible than platemail. The name and the red hair stem from a very early concept for the game. The 
								working title at first was Hibernia, which is the Latin name for Ireland. I eventually moved away from this because I felt like I might restrict myself 
								too much if I decided to try and recreate something that already exists in our world. The name and the hair grew on me (not literally) so I kept both. 
								Her hair is a lot different in this early concept because of a photo reference I sent in where I forgot to add my description of the hair. 
							</p>
							<p>
							The colors for the armor took inspiration from a League of Legends skin for the character Quinn. Her Woad Skin <a href="http://riot.com/2sRANve" 
								target="_blank">here</a> was what I provided as a reference for the leather armor I wanted Fiona to have. You can see the inspiration but 
								Fiona's armor is still unique in its own right.

							<p>
								For the final concept I had the chest piece moved down to cover her stomach. I didn't want her to have a window that screamed "Stab me!". 
								The hairstyle changed from a short cut to the ponytail she has now. The image above isn't the actual final concept piece but when that gets 
								finished I'll post it here.
